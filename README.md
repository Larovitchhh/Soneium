# Soneium
Soneium: the Sony blockchain. Layer 2 of ETH
Soneium Chain Specifics: Since "Soneium chain" is not a well-known blockchain (possibly a typo or niche project), I’ve assumed a generic blockchain structure. If you have specific details (e.g., it’s a layer-2 solution, uses a specific language, or has a unique consensus mechanism), please provide them, and I can tailor the repository further.

Topics: Adding soneium-chain as a topic helps others find the repository. You can also add related topics like blockchain, smart-contracts, or web3.

Collaboration: If you want others to contribute, create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines.

Automation: Consider adding a GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., for linting or testing smart contracts) in a .github/workflows/ folder if the project grows.
